### This is a personal repository to collect my tries at the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in various languages I'm familiar with.
### So far it contains examples in Javascript, Python, Ruby, C++, Java and PHP.
### I was going to add C# at some point but figured out there was no much use given the ones already present.
